# Code of Conduct

## How do we plan to collaborate?
- During software development, we encourage a *pair programming* where the members sit and work together towards the common goal.
- Through *weekly stand-up meetings*, we make sure that all members are updated with other members' work progress; this would facilitate the teamâ€™s work as well as enable the team to identify hinders earlier. On each week, there will be three meetings to discuss what we have done and what we plan to work on. The specific occassions are as below: 
    - *Mondays* online, time depends on planning
    - *Tuesdays* on campus after lectures
    - *Thursday* on campus after lectures

## How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?
- During the meetings, we shall make sure everyone is satisfied with the work distribution. In the meetings, all members are encouraged to bring up problems, demonstrate their progress and ask questions.
- When there is a member having a trouble with completing assigned tasks, the team shall help out. 


## How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?
- In every meeting, meeting notes shall be taken and they shall be shared on the Google drive afterwards.
- When working on Git, the members shall make sure that the work is done following best practices. 
- Other artifacts relevant to the project will be available on either Git or Google Drive.

## What is our usual communication plan?
The main communication channel will be our Discord server, all members are expected to stay up to date and read what is posted there.
- Discord for daily communication
- Trello for Kanban board
- GitLab for software code
- Drive for other documentation, such as meeting notes, diagrams

For meetings the team shall collaboratively create an agenda beforehand and try to focus on it during meetings to reduce time spent on unorganized discussions. 

## What are our conflict prevention strategies? 
Having respect to diversity and inclusion in mind, everyone's ideas and suggestion shall be considered in the same manner. By having open and respectful communication we aim to prevent any conflicts between team members. Members are encouraged to bring up any concerns they have with the group before they escalate into a conflict.

The group shall establish clear goals and expectations regarding each task so that all members are clear about what is expected of them and others.

## How will we solve conflicts? 
- When it comes to a conflict related to work, the issue shall be resolved majority vote of the team. 
- When it comes to a conflicts between individual members, they are responsible for resolving it. If that does not work, the issue shall be brought up and solved in the group. In worst case, the teacher and teaching assistant could intervene to help out the resolution.
